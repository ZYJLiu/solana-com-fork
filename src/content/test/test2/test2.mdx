## Overview

This is a shared convention for organizing your pages, followed by all file-system based content sources including Fumadocs MDX.

## File

A [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) or Markdown file.

### Frontmatter

By default, it includes:

| name          | description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | The title of page                                  |
| `description` | The description of page                            |
| `icon`        | The name of icon, see [Icons](#icons)              |
| `full`        | Fill all available space on the page (Fumadocs UI) |

You may extend your content source to add additional properties.

```mdx

## Folder

Organize multiple pages. When not specified, the display name will be generated from its folder name.

Pages are sorted alphabetically, except for `index.mdx` which is always ordered at the top.

To customise folders, see [Meta file](#meta).

### Folder Group

By default, putting a file into folder will change its slugs and generated page URL.
You can use folder group to add a folder without impacting the slugs of child files.

To create a folder group, wrap the folder name in parentheses.
